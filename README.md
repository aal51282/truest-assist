## Challenges We Faced and How We Overcame Them  

### 1. Leveraging Team Strengths Effectively  
**Challenge:** Initially, we faced difficulties in assigning tasks efficiently, as we weren’t fully aware of each team member’s strengths.  
**Solution:** We took the time to assess our individual skills and interests, allowing us to delegate tasks more strategically. This improved workflow, collaboration, and overall productivity.  

### 2. Overcoming Hesitation in Seeking External Guidance  
**Challenge:** At first, we were hesitant to attend workshops and approach company booths, thinking we had to solve everything on our own.  
**Solution:** We stepped out of our comfort zones, engaged with industry professionals, and attended workshops. This gave us valuable insights that significantly improved our project’s direction and quality.  

### 3. Bridging Knowledge Gaps  
**Challenge:** Some aspects of financial analytics and gamification were new to us, making it difficult to implement certain features.  
**Solution:** We actively researched, collaborated, and incorporated insights from workshops to enhance our understanding. This helped us build a more well-rounded and effective project.
