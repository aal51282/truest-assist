Welcome to our lesson on the differences between depreciation and amortization. While both are non-cash expenses that allocate the cost of assets over time, they apply to different types of assets and have distinct characteristics.

Depreciation is used for tangible assets - physical assets you can touch and see. These include:
- Buildings
- Machinery
- Vehicles
- Office equipment
- Manufacturing equipment

The purpose of depreciation is to spread the cost of these physical assets over their useful life. For example, if you buy a machine for $100,000 with a 10-year useful life, you might depreciate $10,000 per year using straight-line depreciation.

Amortization, on the other hand, is used for intangible assets - assets that have value but no physical form. These include:
- Patents
- Trademarks
- Copyrights
- Software licenses
- Customer lists

Like depreciation, amortization spreads the cost over the asset's useful life. For instance, if you purchase a patent for $50,000 that lasts 20 years, you would amortize $2,500 per year.

Key differences between depreciation and amortization:
1. Asset Type: Tangible vs. Intangible
2. Salvage Value: Depreciated assets often have salvage value, while amortized assets typically don't
3. Methods: Depreciation can use various methods (straight-line, declining balance), while amortization typically uses straight-line

Both depreciation and amortization are important for:
- Tax purposes
- Financial reporting
- Understanding true business costs
- Making investment decisions

Remember, while these are non-cash expenses, they represent real costs of doing business and must be considered when evaluating a company's financial performance.
